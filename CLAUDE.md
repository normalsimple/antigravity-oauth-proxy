## Required Steps

After making code changes, always run:
- `mise run format` - Format Go code using goimports and gofumpt
- `mise run test` - Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `mise run build` - Build the proxy binary for local use
- `mise run run` - Run the proxy locally on port 9877
- `mise run build-worker` - Build for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- `mise run wrangler-dev` - Run local development server with Wrangler

### Development
- `mise run test` - Run all tests
- `go test ./internal/server -v` - Run specific package tests with verbose output

## High-Level Architecture

This is a Go proxy server that transforms standard Gemini API requests into Google's internal CloudCode format used by Gemini Code Assist API.

### Core Components

#### Server (`internal/server/`)
- `server.go` - Main HTTP server with routing and request handling
- `admin_middleware.go` - Admin API middleware (protected by `ADMIN_API_KEY`)
- `chat_completions_handler.go` - OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint
- `stream_generate_content_handler.go` - Gemini streaming/non-streaming content endpoints
- `models_handler.go` - OpenAI-style models listing/details endpoint
- `gemini_helpers.go` - Shared helpers (model normalization, path parsing, SSE unwrap)
- `http_client*.go` - HTTP client abstractions (separate Workers vs default implementations)

#### Credentials (`internal/credentials/`)
- **provider.go** - Interface for credential management
- **file_provider.go** - File-based credentials (local development)
- **cloudflare_kv_provider.go** - KV-based credentials (Workers deployment)
- Auto-handles OAuth token refresh when expired

#### Environment (`internal/env/`)
- **env.go** - Environment variable access for standard Go
- **env_workers.go** - Environment variable access for Workers runtime

### Dual Deployment Architecture

The codebase supports two deployment modes:

1. **Local/Traditional** (`cmd/antigravity-oauth-proxy/`) - Uses FileProvider for credentials
2. **Cloudflare Workers** (`cmd/antigravity-oauth-proxy-worker/`) - Uses CloudflareKVProvider for credentials

### Key Transformations

1. **URL Rewriting**: `/v1beta/models/MODEL:ACTION` → `/v1internal:ACTION`
2. **Model Normalization**: Any model containing "pro"→"gemini-2.5-pro", "flash"→"gemini-2.5-flash"
3. **Request Wrapping**: Standard Gemini requests wrapped in CloudCode format with project ID
4. **Response Unwrapping**: CloudCode responses unwrapped from "response" field
5. **SSE Streaming**: Real-time transformation of Server-Sent Events for streaming responses

### Authentication Flow

- Uses OAuth credentials (access_token, refresh_token) to authenticate with CloudCode API
- Automatically refreshes expired tokens using refresh_token
- For Workers: Admin API allows secure credential upload/management
- Supports both environment-provided project ID or auto-discovery via CloudCode API

### Workers-Specific Considerations

- Cannot access filesystem - uses CloudflareKVProvider instead of FileProvider
- HTTP client uses Workers-compatible fetch API (`github.com/syumai/workers`)
- Graceful fallback for missing http.Flusher support in streaming responses
- Admin API required for credential management (no file access)

## Important Patterns

- All logging uses zerolog (`internal/logger`) with structured logging
- Environment variables handled through `internal/env` abstraction
- Credential providers implement common interface for different storage backends
- Server supports both regular JSON and SSE streaming responses
- Middleware applied to admin-protected routes (credentials, streaming, chat)

## Performance Considerations

### Request Compression
- **IMPORTANT**: Request body compression is intentionally disabled. Testing revealed that CloudCode API has severe performance issues with gzip-compressed requests (50+ seconds vs 2.6 seconds without compression).
- The proxy sends all requests uncompressed to ensure optimal streaming performance.
- This was discovered through debugging where direct `curl` requests to CloudCode API (without compression) were significantly faster than proxy requests with compression.
